      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p><strong>ARZA</strong> is a high-performance hardware company founded by gamers and creators who were tired of compromises. We build PCs that are purpose-driven, future-ready, and unapologetically powerful — because you deserve machines as serious as your ambitions.</p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We exist to empower the next generation of creators, game devs, streamers, and competitive players with systems that don’t just keep up — they lead. Whether you’re compiling code, rendering cinematic scenes, or raiding at 240Hz, ARZA systems are tuned to dominate.</p>
      <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No compromise builds:</strong> Only premium components. Zero budget bottlenecks. Built to last.</li>
        <li><strong>Creator-first design:</strong> Focused on thermal headroom, workload stability, and speed under pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization without chaos:</strong> We keep it simple, but powerful — your specs, your style, our build.</li>
        <li><strong>Human support:</strong> No bots, no scripts — just real pros who know their tech and care about your rig.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Our Process</h2>
      <p>Each system is hand-assembled, cable-managed, thermally optimized, and stress-tested under real-world loads before shipping. We don’t just throw parts in a case — we craft machines you can rely on every day, for years.</p>
