  <h2>❓ FAQ</h2>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I install Linux instead of Windows?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Yes. All ARZA systems support Linux and dual-boot setups. But we only ship systems with a pre-installed OS — either Windows 11 Pro or Linux Mint. No barebones builds.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How long does delivery take?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Most systems ship within 7–14 business days after confirming your build. Custom loops or high-end parts may add time — we’ll let you know if there’s a delay.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I request specific brands for parts?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Definitely. Just include your preferences during your build submission. We'll honor them based on availability and budget.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What's covered under warranty?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Everything — CPU, GPU, RAM, SSDs, fans, etc. — is covered under a 2-year warranty (parts & labor). But if there’s **clear, intentional damage**, tampering, or abuse, warranty is void. We don’t fix sabotage.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What if my PC is damaged during shipping?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> We don’t control third-party shipping. If there’s visible damage on delivery, file a claim directly with the shipping provider or retailer (if not bought through us). We pack tight — but accidents happen. Document it fast.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> My warranty is still active. What do I need for a repair?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Email us first. Then send us the full setup — charger, the device, and any essentials it needs to run. Missing items = possible delays or limitations in repairs.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Warranty’s expired. Am I out of luck?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> Not at all. We offer out-of-warranty repairs at a fair price. You'll just cover parts and labor. Reach out, and we’ll get you sorted.</p>
